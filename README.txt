This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to construct a weighted Majority Vote meta-model for the purposes of predicting object categories on the Caltech-101 dataset. Our results properly predict object category correctly ~30% of the time with ~25 training samples per category. Instructions on how to run the project are below.
See the Project Report.pdf for a full report on the methodology and results of the Machine Learning Project.

Instructions to run:
Open Project_422.m in matlab
Press Run.

Configuration Concerns:
Make sure the folder is on your matlab path
Make sure all .m files on github, as well as the caltech 101 dataset folder named "101_objectcategories" is co-located with Project_422.m 
Created in matlab 2017a. Not sure which matlab version it requires, but use 2017a to be safe.
